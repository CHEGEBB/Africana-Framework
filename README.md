# üåê The Africana-Framework For Hackes. Simple But Lethal!! üåê

* Africana-framework is a REDTEAM Penetration Testing Framework written in pure Python3. 
* It aims to make penetration testing easier for testers by covering a wide range of attack vectors including;
 web exploitation, WiFi attacks, phishing, malware generation, social engineering attacks, password cracking, and internal network attacks.

## Disclaimer: üöß Hacking is addictive  üòÇ, Yoooh! " With Great power.."üëÄ You know the drill. üöß**

*Africana is strictly designed for educational purposes only. If you think you're about to become the next cyber-vigilante, think again.**<br>
*This tool won't magically turn you into a hacking wizard overnight. It's more like a virtual playground for learning the art (and science) of ethical hacking.**<br>
*üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Don't even think about using this tool for anything illegal or malicious. The cyber police will find you, and they won't be amused.**
